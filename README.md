> An \*arr Request Bot for Telegram based on [Doplarr](https://github.com/kiranshila/Doplarr) for Discord

## Why does this exist

- Uses Telegram slash commands and components, which provides a clean, performant UI on desktop and mobile.
- Small codebase as [code is not an asset](https://robinbb.com/blog/code-is-not-an-asset/)
- Simple configuration, no need to have a whole web frontend just for configuration
